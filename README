This tool attempts to resize and crop an image to the most complex
region to match the aspect ratio of the given size. The region
complexity is considered to be the region with the most edges as
detected by a Sobel edge detection filter done against a luminance map
of the input images for RGB and RGBA inputs, or against the image
itself for Grayscale and Grayscale + alpha images.
